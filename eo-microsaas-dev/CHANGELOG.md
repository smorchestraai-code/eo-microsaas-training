## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-25

Weekend-shipment release. Recalibrates the plugin around one promise: a non-technical founder takes an EO-Brain package on Friday evening, builds through Saturday, and ships to production by Sunday night. Everything in this release supports that promise — visible sequence, hidden plumbing, lean defaults, CEO voice.

### Added
- **Numbered build chain 1–10** — every build command is now prefixed with its sequence number. `/1-eo-dev-start` → `/2-eo-dev-plan` → `/3-eo-code` → `/4-eo-review` → `/5-eo-score` → `/6-eo-bridge-gaps` → `/7-eo-ship`, plus lifecycle `/8-eo-dev-repair`, `/9-eo-debug`, `/10-eo-retro`. Utilities (`/eo-guide`, `/eo-status`, `/eo-github`) stay unnumbered. A non-technical founder can read the command palette top-to-bottom and know what to run next.
- **`/eo-freeze` + `/eo-unfreeze` edit-boundary helpers** — scope Claude's writes to one folder for the rest of the session. Wraps `gstack:freeze` / `gstack:unfreeze` when the `gstack` plugin is present; falls back to a session-local rule otherwise. Kills "Claude rewrote three files while fixing one button."
- **SaaSfast mode picker (M0–M3)** — `/1-eo-dev-start` Step 8b reads the BRD + ICP and picks exactly one mode:
  - **M0 — None** (not a web app)
  - **M1 — Backend-only** (directory / marketplace / content — default for ambiguous cases)
  - **M2 — Gate-only** (marketing + gated app)
  - **M3 — Core stack** (traditional SaaS)
  The decision is recorded at the top of `architecture/tech-stack-decision.md` and every downstream command reads and respects it.
- **Three new side-car SOPs** under `skills/eo-dev-start/`:
  - `SAASFAST-MODES.md` — the four modes, picking heuristic, per-mode scaffold subset, mode-switch discipline.
  - `PAYMENT-PROVIDER-SWAPS.md` — Tap / HyperPay / Moyasar / PayTabs / Stripe scaffold diffs, common interface, MENA defaults (Tap for Gulf, HyperPay for KSA-only, Stripe for global).
  - `EO-SPECIFIC-LAYER.md` — the 5 files scaffolded on top of M1/M2/M3 (founder-profile schema, MENA font + phone defaults, distribution skeletons, Supabase RLS policy templates).
- **`handover-bridge` Step 4b + Step 4c** — mode-aware scaffold and BRD post-process:
  - Step 4 branches on `saasfast_mode` + `payment_provider` passed from `eo-dev-start`. M0 scaffolds per raw stack; M1 is Next.js + backend-only; M2/M3 add SaaSfast frontend layers.
  - Step 4b installs the EO-specific layer on top of M1/M2/M3 from plugin templates.
  - Step 4c parses the copied BRD and injects two framing blocks: **Weekend MVP** (stories 1–4) and **v2 Phase** (stories 5+ with `[@Phase2]` tagging). Idempotent. `brd-traceability` skill honors the tag — Phase 2 ACs don't count against MVP shipment.
- **Self-scoring gates on `/7-eo-ship`, `/8-eo-dev-repair`, `/9-eo-debug`** — every "done" declaration re-invokes `eo-scorer`. No more shipping on a stale score or closing a bug without re-checking the affected AC:
  - `/7-eo-ship` — full 5-hat pass on HEAD. ≥ 90 ship; 80–89 bounce to `/6-eo-bridge-gaps`; < 80 refuse and route to `/2-eo-dev-plan`.
  - `/8-eo-dev-repair` — mode-consistency check + re-score affected story scope. ≥ 80 accepted; < 80 routes to `/3-eo-code`.
  - `/9-eo-debug` — re-score affected AC after fix + tests green. ≥ 80 closed; < 80 keeps bug open + flags follow-up.
- **Hidden plumbing wired into every numbered command** — gstack + superpowers skills preferred, internal fallbacks always present. Founder never sees "skill missing" errors. Per-command mapping documented under each command's "Hidden plumbing" section.
- **GitHub push step in `/7-eo-ship`** — remote-aware. Auto-invokes `eo-github` when no remote exists; asks once if `github_intent=local-only` still active.
- **Weekend cadence in `_dev-progress.md` template** — seeded with 7 rows (4 MVP + 3 v2 🧊 frozen). Phase column shows MVP vs v2 at a glance. Cadence table replaced (5-week sprint plan → Fri/Sat/Sun weekend plan).

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md.template`** — Voice § now enforces CEO-brief tone for every founder-facing artifact (`docs/qa-scores/`, `docs/handovers/`, `docs/retros/`, `_dev-progress.md`). No 5-hat composite tables visible, no `aria-invalid`, no "setSession fragility". Engineering detail lives under `docs/engineering/`. The hidden plumbing (gstack / superpowers / subagent names) stays hidden — the founder sees only the numbered chain + utilities.
- **`handover-bridge` quality checks 9/9 → 12/12** — adds mode-line-present, mode-consistent-scaffold, BRD blocks-present-when-story-count-over-4.
- **`eo-dev-start` self-score protocol 14 → 16** — adds mode-picked, payment-resolved.
- **Marketplace description (`1.1.0` → `1.2.0`)** — rewritten around weekend-shipment promise and full numbered chain.

### Migration — 1.3.x → 1.4.0

Existing projects keep working. New projects scaffold with the numbered chain and mode-aware layer.

- **Existing projects built on 1.3.x** continue to work. Their `docs/qa-scores/` / `docs/plans/` / commits reference the un-numbered chain and stay valid as history. Students can switch to numbered commands immediately — behavior is identical.
- **New projects** run `/1-eo-dev-start` — the mode picker runs at Step 8b, the BRD is post-processed at handover-bridge Step 4c, `_dev-progress.md` seeds 7 rows with 4 MVP + 3 v2 frozen.
- **Installing `gstack` or `superpowers` is optional.** If installed, their skills take over the matching steps. If not, internal fallbacks run. Founder never sees the difference.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **`/eo-github` command + `eo-github` skill** — the only plugin surface allowed to create, wire, or audit a GitHub remote. Four modes:
  - **Mode 1 `create`** — creates a new private repo under the authenticated user, applies best-practices settings (squash-merge only, `has_wiki`/`has_projects`/`has_discussions` off, `delete_branch_on_merge` on, EO topics + labels), wires origin, pushes the first commit.
  - **Mode 2 `point-existing`** — validates an already-created empty repo is writable and empty, shows a settings-drift diff vs the best-practices matrix, wires origin, pushes. Offers `skip-settings` to keep the repo's current config.
  - **Mode 3 `guided`** — A/B/C menu for students who said "I don't know" in `/eo-dev-start`'s 4-option question. Routes into Mode 1 or Mode 2.
  - **Mode 4 `audit`** — reads current repo state via MCP, computes drift vs the best-practices matrix, prints a per-item `y/n` drift report. Runs automatically after first `/eo-ship` green CI to offer branch-protection activation.
- **MCP-only contract** — the skill requires `mcp__github__*` tools. No `gh` CLI fallback. Refuses cleanly with install remediation when MCP is missing. This keeps "the skill works" identical to "the skill works the way the student expects."
- **Plan-aware feature offering** — detects GitHub plan (free/pro/team/enterprise) once per session. Never offers plan-locked features (required reviewers, CODEOWNERS enforcement) on plans that would silently ignore them. Students on free plans see only features their plan can honor.
- **Branch strategy picked from collaborator count** — solo (≤1) → trunk-only (`main` only); team (≥2) → dual-branch (`main` production + `dev` integration). Plan preview shows the choice; student can override in the approval step.
- **Post-first-CI branch protection** — protection rules can't require status checks that have never run. The skill defers protection to after first `/eo-ship` green CI, then offers activation via `/eo-github audit`.
- **Naming rules enforced at slug sanitization** — lowercase-only, ASCII+hyphen, 3-60 chars, reserved-name rejection (`api`, `www`, `admin`, etc.), `eo-` prefix auto-applied when `mena_flag=true`. No silent renames — if a name fails validation, the student is prompted.
- **Issue labels preset** — `bug`, `enhancement`, `blocked`, `needs-info`, `mena`, `score-gap` (skips any already present; never renames existing labels).
- **Failure rollback with manifest** — every write tracked; mid-flight failure → roll back only writes from this invocation. Never auto-deletes a GitHub repo (destructive — student confirms manually).

### Changed
- **`/eo-dev-start` Step 9b** — adds the **one-question-four-options** GitHub intent gate. When no origin is mounted, asks: `1. Create new repo` / `2. Point to existing repo` / `3. Continue locally` / `4. I don't know`. Detects `mcp__github__*` MCP presence. Routes 1/2/4+MCP to `eo-github` after `handover-bridge`; option 3 or 4-without-MCP stays fully local (no git init, no remote). Step 10b wires the post-bridge skill invocation.
- **`handover-bridge` Step 3 + Step 9** — `git init` and first commit are now conditional on `github_intent`. For `local-only`, no git repo is initialized and no commit is made — students who chose option 3 stay fully local. For every other value, git init happens locally but `git remote add origin` is never run (`eo-github` owns that). `git push` is never invoked here.
- **`eo-guide` v1.3** — adds three new phase states:
  - `local-only-bootstrapped` — bootstrap complete, no `.git/` → "Keep building locally. When your MVP works end-to-end, run `/eo-github`."
  - `git-local-no-remote` — git initialized, no `remote.origin.url` → routes to `/eo-github`.
  - `ready-to-ship-but-no-remote` — score ≥ 90 but no remote → routes to `/eo-github` before `/eo-ship`.
  Mode 2 `/eo-status` dashboard now shows a Git row (local/remote/no-git). Two new filesystem signals scanned: `.git/` presence and `remote.origin.url`.
- **Plugin description + README** — command count 12→13, skill count 10→11. File layout updated.

### Architecture notes
- **Isolation of remote operations:** `/eo-dev-start` is cheap to retry; students can trial the bootstrap three times before "this is the one" without polluting GitHub. All remote writes live in one skill (`eo-github`) with one contract (MCP + plan-mode preview).
- **Single source of truth for GitHub status:** `git config --get remote.origin.url`. No new config file introduced — `.claude/project.json` was considered and rejected as unnecessary complexity.
- **The skill is the admin, the student is the CEO:** admin decisions (settings, branches, labels, topics) are made by the skill from best practices; every decision is previewed and approved before writing. Audit mode lets the student correct drift later without re-bootstrapping.

### Migration notes
- **Existing v1.2.0 students with already-wired remotes:** no change. `/eo-dev-start` detects the origin and skips the 4-option question; the existing URL is preserved.
- **Existing v1.2.0 students with local git but no remote:** `/eo-guide` will now surface `git-local-no-remote` and route to `/eo-github`. Run it when ready to push.
- **No breaking changes** for any command or skill. The 4-option question is additive — students with already-wired remotes never see it.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **`/eo-dev-start` command + skill** — one-shot bootstrap for fresh EO MicroSaaS projects.
  - Reads EO-Brain phases 0-4 (`1-ProjectBrain/`, `4-Architecture/`) as source of truth.
  - Worktree-aware workspace root resolution (`$GIT_WORK_TREE` → `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, never `pwd`).
  - Scans 11 bootstrap signals, classifies state: `empty` | `partial` | `bootstrapped`.
  - Plan-mode gate before any write — previews every file + template source + expected bytes.
  - Routes `partial` → `/eo-dev-repair`, `bootstrapped` → `/eo-guide`. Refuses to re-bootstrap.
  - Invokes `handover-bridge` only on approval. Emits evidence table (bytes + line counts) on completion.
  - Bilingual (Arabic-first Gulf if `EO-Brain/_language-pref.md` = `ar`, English otherwise).
- **`/eo-dev-repair` command + skill** — surgical triage for partially-bootstrapped projects.
  - Classifies every missing signal into one of two classes:
    - **Silent-repair-safe** (regeneratable from templates): `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/lessons.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `_dev-progress.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, placeholder tests, `docs/ux-reference/`, doc subdirs.
    - **Refuse-and-route** (must come from EO-Brain phases 0-4): `architecture/brd.md`, `architecture/tech-stack-decision.md`, `EO-Brain/1-ProjectBrain/{icp,brandvoice,positioning}.md`, EO-Brain itself.
  - **Hard contract:** mixed state (some silent-repair-safe + some refuse-and-route missing) → refuse all repair. Surface the root cause. Partial repair masks upstream gaps.
  - Plan-mode gate shows exact rebuild list before any write. Never overwrites existing files (lessons.md preserved if present).
  - Failure rollback: manifest written before first write; on any mid-flight failure, deletes only files this invocation created.
  - Commit message: `chore(repair): regenerate {list of files} via eo-dev-repair`.
- **`eo-guide` v1.2** — phase detector routes new states to new commands:
  - `pre-bootstrap` (truly empty project) → `/eo-dev-start` (supersedes the old "copy-paste Section 5 prompt" flow).
  - `bootstrap-incomplete` (partial state) → `/eo-dev-repair`.
  - Frontmatter + header version bumped 1.1 → 1.2.
- **Simplified `EO-Brain/5-CodeHandover/README.md` Section 5** — the 75-line bootstrap prompt is replaced with a one-line pointer: `/eo-dev-start`. Zero copy-paste friction.

### Changed
- Plugin description updated to reference 12 commands + 10 skills (was 8 commands + 7 skills).
- README file-layout diagram lists new commands/skills with v1.2.0 annotations.

### Architecture note
The new split cleanly separates concerns:
- `/eo-dev-start` = happy-path bootstrap (empty → ready).
- `/eo-dev-repair` = triage (partial → repaired or refused with remediation).
- `/eo-guide` = router (any state → next correct command).

This mirrors the smorch-dev pattern (`/smo-dev-start` → `/smo-dev-repair` → `/smo-dev-guide`) so engineers moving between EO and SMO see the same mental model.

### Migration notes
- **Existing v1.1.0 students:** `claude plugin update eo-microsaas-dev@eo-microsaas-training`. Bootstrapped projects are unaffected — `/eo-guide` continues to work. New projects use `/eo-dev-start` instead of the old copy-paste prompt.
- **Students mid-bootstrap:** if a previous Section-5-prompt run left the project partial, run `/eo-dev-repair` — it will triage and either silently complete or tell you exactly which EO-Brain phase to finish.
- **No breaking changes.** All prior commands and skills retain behavior.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- **`eo-guide` skill** — returning-student phase detector + next-command router. Reads filesystem state (10 signals), infers phase, recommends next `/eo-*` command. Worktree-aware. Bilingual output (Gulf Arabic if `MENA: yes` / `lang: ar` in project CLAUDE.md). Safety rail: never recommends `/eo-ship` when state is inconsistent.
- **`/eo-guide` command** — Mode 1 full recommendation.
- **`/eo-status` command** — Mode 2 compact dashboard (status only, no coaching).
- **handover-bridge hardening**:
  - Step 0 precondition — aborts if `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/settings.json` missing.
  - Step 5b — generates `.github/workflows/ci.yml` from new template.
  - Step 6b — seeds `_dev-progress.md` with one row per BRD story.
  - Quality checks extended to **HANDOVER READINESS 9/9**.
- **Templates:**
  - `templates/ci.yml.template` — Node 22 PR gate (lint + test + build + `npm audit --audit-level=high`).
  - `templates/_dev-progress.md.template` — story tracker with status legend + MVP cadence reference.
- **`_dev-progress.md` dual-writer pattern** — every `/eo-*` command that touches story state now updates its row:
  - `/eo-plan` → status `📝 planned`
  - `/eo-code` → status `🔨 coding` / `🧪 scoring`, tests passing/total
  - `/eo-score` → composite score, status gate
  - `/eo-bridge-gaps` → status `🩹 bridging gaps`, hat bridged
  - `/eo-ship` → status `✅ shipped`, date, commit sha
  - `/eo-retro` → appends retro link to top-of-file metadata
- **`eo-guide/fixtures/README.md`** — 8-fixture catalog (01-pre-bootstrap through 08-inconsistent) for manual regression.

### Changed
- `handover-bridge` Output Contract now requires `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `_dev-progress.md` at project root.
- Student-facing ship gate clarified: only `/eo-ship` can set `Status = ✅ shipped`. `/eo-score` at 90+ sets `🧪 scoring` (waiting to ship).

### Migration notes
- **Existing v1.0.0 students:** `claude plugin update eo-microsaas-dev@eo-microsaas-training`. No action required on existing projects — `_dev-progress.md` is optional for already-shipped stories; `/eo-guide` will seed it on first invocation if missing.
- **Fresh installs:** `install.sh` at the training-repo root picks up 1.1.0 automatically via marketplace.
- **No breaking changes.** Commands and skills retain prior behavior; new skill + templates are additive.

### Known follow-ups (not in this release)
- Windows PowerShell hooks (`destructive-blocker.ps1`, `secret-scanner.ps1`) — tracked under `templates/hooks-windows/`.
- Automated fixture test harness — fixtures ship as manual-regression only for 1.1.0.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Initial release.
- 8 slash commands: `/eo-plan`, `/eo-code`, `/eo-review`, `/eo-score`, `/eo-bridge-gaps`, `/eo-ship`, `/eo-debug`, `/eo-retro`.
- 7 skills: `eo-scorer`, `lessons-manager`, `brd-traceability`, `elegance-pause`, `arabic-rtl-checker`, `mena-mobile-check`, `handover-bridge`.
- 5-Hat scoring rubric (Product, Architecture, Engineering, QA, UX) with student calibration — 90+ composite ship gate.
- Self-improvement loop via `.claude/lessons.md`.
- MENA-specific checks: Arabic RTL rendering, 375px mobile viewport.
- BRD traceability via `@AC-N.N` tags.
